Quadratic_Calculator
====================

Quadratic calculator using error handling

You will be prompted to enter the coefficients a,b and c for the quadratic equation.
Then, the required result will be displayed.

Another equation can then be solved by pressing 'y'. To quit, press any other key.

'Quadratic_Calculator_Setjmp_Longjmp.c' is a C code implemented using setjmp - longjmp method,

'Quadratic_Calculator_Try_Catch.cpp' is a C++ code implemented using try - catch method and the Complex class form
the first question is used to handle the complex numbers which may arise as roots of the equations.

'comparison' is the comparison of the two methods.
